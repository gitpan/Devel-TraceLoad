For installing this module what you can do is simply to execute the
following commands:

% perl Makefile.PL
% make 
% make test 
% make install

If a test fails, try the following:

% make test TEST_VERBOSE=1 TEST_LOG=1 

On a windows system, you can use the pmake wich is a make written in
perl, available on the CPAN.

Without "make" you can write something like this:

% perl -It -Ilib -MDevel::TraceLoad t/all.t
